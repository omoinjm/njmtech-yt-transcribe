 Don't start applying for coding jobs
 until you've done this one thing.
 Go to this website, huggingface.co, click on models.
 Then on the left side of the screen,
 there should be a section called tasks.
 Screenshot that entire section.
 Go to chat GPT, paste the image in, and type this.
 Based on the screenshot I provided,
 which shows a full list of available AI models
 on huggingface.co, come up with a unique
 and technically impressive coding project
 that would stand out in the 2025 job market,
 be portfolio worthy for a software engineer,
 integrate one or more of the tasks shown
 in the screenshot, be feasible for a solo engineer
 or a small team to build in one to three months,
 utilize real world data, APIs, and scenarios
 to showcase practical value.
 Project should go beyond simple demos
 and show thoughtfulness and architecture,
 user experience, and future scalability.
 This include a clear project name,
 what it does, and what real world problem it solves,
 key hugging face tasks it uses,
 demand a tech stack, and ideas on how to show off
 the value of the project on my resume.
 This prompt will give you the perfect project
 the landage awful prompt is in the caption below.
