## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of `yt-transcribe` seriously. If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities, we encourage you to report them to us as quickly as possible. Your help in keeping this project secure is greatly appreciated.

### How to Report

Please **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, report them privately by sending an email to:

When reporting, please include the following information:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Explain the potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Versions:** Which versions or commits of `yt-transcribe` are affected?
*   **Proof of Concept (Optional but Recommended):** Any code, scripts, or examples that demonstrate the vulnerability.

### Our Commitment

*   We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 2-3 business days.
*   We will investigate the report thoroughly and keep you updated on the progress.
*   We will notify you once the vulnerability has been addressed.
*   We will credit you for your responsible disclosure, if you wish to be named, upon the resolution of the issue.

### Disclosure Policy

We kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it. We aim to fix critical issues promptly and coordinate public disclosure with you once a fix is available.

Thank you for your responsible disclosure!
