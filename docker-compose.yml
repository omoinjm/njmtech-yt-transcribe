    # If you want to run the application directly using docker compose,
    # you might want to specify command line arguments here.
    # For example, to run with a specific URL and output directory:
    # command: -url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" -output "/app/output"
    #
    # You might also want to mount volumes for persistent data or configuration.
    # volumes:
    #   - ./output:/app/output
    #
    # Environment variables can be set here if needed, e.g., for WHISPER_MODEL_PATH:
    # environment:
    #   - WHISPER_MODEL_PATH=/whisper.cpp/models/ggml-base.en.bin
    #
    # Expose ports if the application were a server, which this CLI tool is not.
    # ports:
    #   - "8080:8080"
